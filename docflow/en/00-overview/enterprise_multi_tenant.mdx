## 01 Enterprise Multi-Tenant Overview

When a user belongs to multiple enterprise accounts and needs to operate or access content under a specific enterprise account, it is necessary to add `x-ti-enterprise-id` in the HTTP header to specify the enterprise ID.

If the user only belongs to one enterprise, this HTTP header is not required.

## 02 Usage

### 2.1 Multiple Enterprises Scenario

When a user belongs to multiple enterprises, it is necessary to add `x-ti-enterprise-id` in the request header to specify the enterprise to operate:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl \
  -H "x-ti-app-id: <your-app-id>" \
  -H "x-ti-secret-code: <your-secret-code>" \
  -H "x-ti-enterprise-id: <your-enterprise-id>" \
  "https://docflow.textin.com/api/app-api/sip/platform/v2/file/upload"
```

</CodeGroup>

### 2.2 Single Enterprise Scenario

If the user only belongs to one enterprise, it is not necessary to add the `x-ti-enterprise-id` header:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl
curl \
  -H "x-ti-app-id: <your-app-id>" \
  -H "x-ti-secret-code: <your-secret-code>" \
  "https://docflow.textin.com/api/app-api/sip/platform/v2/file/upload"
```

</CodeGroup>

## 03 Get Enterprise ID
