<Tip>
  This document demonstrates how to retry file tasks in DocFlow through REST API. When file processing fails or needs to be reprocessed, you can use the retry interface.
</Tip>

DocFlow provides a file retry interface that supports reprocessing specified tasks. The retry operation will re-execute the complete processing flow including parsing, classification, splitting, extraction, etc.

<Warning>
**Important Restriction**: Only tasks that have extraction succeeded or failed, and are main tasks or parent tasks, can be retried. Child tasks do not support retry operations.
</Warning>

## Retry File Processing

Reprocess files corresponding to specified task IDs:

<CodeGroup>

```bash curl icon=terminal wrap
curl -X POST \
  -H "x-ti-app-id: <your-app-id>" \
  -H "x-ti-secret-code: <your-secret-code>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspace_id": "<your-workspace-id>",
    "task_id": "1978297791713619968"
  }' \
  "https://docflow.textin.com/api/app-api/sip/platform/v2/file/retry"
```

```python Python expandable icon=python lines
import requests
import json

ti_app_id = "<your-app-id>"
ti_secret_code = "<your-secret-code>"
workspace_id = "<your-workspace-id>"
task_id = "1978297791713619968"

host = "https://docflow.textin.com"
url = "/api/app-api/sip/platform/v2/file/retry"

headers = {
    "x-ti-app-id": ti_app_id,
    "x-ti-secret-code": ti_secret_code,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}

payload = {
    "workspace_id": workspace_id,
    "task_id": task_id
}

resp = requests.post(
    url=f"{host}{url}",
    json=payload,
    headers=headers,
    timeout=60,
)

print(resp.status_code, resp.text)
result = resp.json()
if result.get("code") == 200:
    print("File retry successful")
else:
    print(f"Retry failed: {result.get('msg')}")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Parameter Description

### Required Parameters

- `workspace_id`: Workspace ID. Please refer to the [Get Workspace ID](../100-faq/get_workspace_id) documentation.
- `task_id`: Task ID. Can be obtained from the file upload interface response or through query interfaces.

### Response Description

After successful retry, the interface returns a standard response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "msg": "success"
}
```

- `code`: Response status code, 200 indicates success
- `msg`: Response message

## Use Cases

The retry interface is suitable for the following scenarios:

1. **Failed Processing Retry**: When file processing fails, you can call the retry interface to reprocess
2. **Retry After Configuration Update**: After updating classification, extraction, and other configurations, you can reprocess already processed files to apply new configurations

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Retry Restrictions**: Only tasks that have extraction succeeded or failed, and are main tasks or parent tasks, can be retried. Child tasks do not support retry operations.
</Warning>

1. **Task Status**: The retry operation will reprocess files, and existing processing results may be overwritten
2. **Processing Time**: The retry operation needs to re-execute the processing flow, which may take some time. It is recommended to check the task status through query interfaces
3. **Task Type Restriction**: Only main tasks or parent tasks can be retried. Child tasks do not support retry
4. **Extraction Status Restriction**: Only tasks with extraction succeeded or failed status can be retried
